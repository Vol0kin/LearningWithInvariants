The current machine learning paradigms consider no further information apart from
the data samples when trying to learn a model that can represent the data and be
used later on to infer information about new samples. During the training process,
the current methods try to minimize the error with respect to the original data, thus
searching the function that best fits the data in an infinite space of functions. However,
the training data has statistical information that can help reduce the searching 
space to a region of it, allowing also to find functions that better fit the data. A recently
proposed data-driven learning paradigm called LUSI tries to take advantage of this information
by preserving some invariants containing interesting statistical properties of the data.
Despite offering good results, the invariants are problem dependent, prior knowledge of the
problem is required when selecting the invariants and it is limited to preserve the information
of only one class at the time. Hence, in this work we propose and study the use of random projections
and random hyperplanes as general use invariants. We observe that the random projections offer
results similar to the original invariants although are a bit limited, whereas the random hyperplanes
fall quite short compared to the other types of invariants. Also, we successfully extend the LUSI
paradigm to multiple classes using the Error Correcting Output Codes framework,
enabling its use in multiclass classification problems.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Dr. Oriol Pujol for giving me the opportunity to work
along with him on this project and supervising my work. Also, I would like to thank him for
constantly encouraging me, giving me new ideas to try when I got stuck on some problem, for
his constant support and for helping me with other academic stuff. It has been a real pleasure
working along with him on this project from the beginning to the end of it.

Second, I would like to thank my parents for unconditionally supporting me and always motivating
me to keep studying the things that I like.

I would also like to thank Pablo Álvarez, who had previously worked on a similar project and whose
work helped me when I got stuck with some issues.

Next, I would like to thank my friends Álvaro, Arseniy and Noah for their constant help, support
and motivation throughout this year. I feel very lucky for having the opportunity to work with them
on different projects throughout the academic year.

Finally but not least, I would like to thank my dear friend Irene for all her help, motivation and
unconditional support, as well as the tips and help that she provided me with to better present the results
of this work and for constantly encouraging me to keep pushing forward while I was working on this thesis.
And my dear friend Otis, for making me take things easier, for his unconditional help and support and for
making my working environment much better in general. And to both of them, thank your for sticking with me while
I was working on this document and for helping me with the experiments.
