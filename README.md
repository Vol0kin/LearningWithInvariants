# Learning with invariants

This repository contains the source code and experiments that I have developed
for my Mater's Thesis, titled "Learning with invariants". Also, the report that
I wrote on the topic is included here, in case that you want to read it and get
more information on the background and the proposals.

## Requirements

This project has been developed using Python 3.10, so using a version equal or
superior to this one guarantees full compatibility.

## Installation

> It is strongly recommended that you create a virtual environment and install the
packages there as not to mess up with your current Python installation.

In order to install the dependencies of this project, run the following command:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
